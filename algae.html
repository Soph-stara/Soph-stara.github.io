        <p>
            <em>How Algae Can Change the World</em> is a curatorial and research-based
            exhibition project exploring algae as a material, ecological, and political
            actor in planetary futures.
        </p>

        <p>
            Developed as part of a group exhibition at Zeppelin University, the project
            contributed a curatorial perspective that translated complex material science
            into an accessible visual and experiential format. The exhibition connected
            research, design, and ecology to question dominant narratives of growth,
            sustainability, and resource extraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project was realized in collaboration with
            <a href="https://www.mujolab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mujō</a>,
            a Berlin-based interdisciplinary team of designers and engineers developing
            biodegradable packaging materials from brown algae. Their research into
            algae-based alternatives to synthetic packaging formed the material and
            conceptual core of the exhibition.
        </p>

        <p>
            We designed a laboratory-like exhibition environment that mirrored mujō’s
            scientific and design-driven research practice. By foregrounding processes,
            material samples, and experimental states, the exhibition made visible the
            transformation of algae from living organism to industrial material.
        </p>

        <p>
            Positioned within broader discourses of biodesign, circular materials, and
            climate-conscious innovation, the project framed algae not only as a solution
            to ecological crisis, but as a lens through which alternative imaginaries of
            production, care, and coexistence can be articulated.
