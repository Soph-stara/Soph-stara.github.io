<h1>How Algae Can Change the World</h1>

<div class="content">
    <p>
        <em>How Algae Can Change the World</em> is a curatorial and research-based
        exhibition project exploring algae as a material, ecological, and political
        actor in planetary futures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Developed as part of a group exhibition at Zeppelin University, the project
        contributed a curatorial perspective that translated complex material science
        into an accessible visual and experiential format. The exhibition connected
        research, design, and ecology to question dominant narratives of growth,
        sustainability, and resource extraction.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project was realized in collaboration with
        <a href="https://www.mujolab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mujō</a>        
        a Berlin-based interdisciplinary team of designers and engineers developing
        biodegradable packaging materials from brown algae. Their research into
        algae-based alternatives to synthetic packaging formed the material and
        conceptual core of the exhibition.
    </p>

    <p>
        We designed a laboratory-like exhibition environment that mirrored mujō’s
        scientific and design-driven research practice. By foregrounding processes,
        material samples, and experimental states, the exhibition made visible the
        transformation of algae from living organism to industrial material.
    </p>

    <p>
        Positioned within broader discourses of biodesign, circular materials, and
        climate-conscious innovation, the project framed algae not only as a solution
        to ecological crisis, but as a lens through which alternative imaginaries of
        production, care, and coexistence can be articulated.
    </p>
