            <h3>The Historical Context</h3>
            <p><strong>The witch hunts were not about superstition.</strong> As feminist historian Silvia Federici argues in "Caliban and the Witch," they were a systematic attack on women's autonomy during the rise of capitalism.</p>
            
            <h4>Why Women Were Targeted:</h4>
            <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto;">
                <li><strong>Economic Independence:</strong> Women who lived alone, had their own income, or controlled property</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Knowledge:</strong> Healers, midwives, and herbalists whose skills challenged emerging male-dominated medicine</li>
                <li><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> Those who opposed new laws restricting women's behavior and mobility</li>
                <li><strong>Control of Reproduction:</strong> Women who knew about contraception, abortion, or childbirth</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>"The witch hunt was a war against women; it was a coordinated effort to degrade them, demonize them, and destroy their social power."</em> - Silvia Federici</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p><strong>Each Round:</strong> You'll draw a tarot card representing a situation or challenge based on historical events during the witch hunts.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> Each card offers two options - often a choice between safety and resistance, or between individual survival and helping others.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Your choices affect your Suspicion Level and number of Allies. Both are crucial for survival.</p>

                <h4>Theoretical Foundation</h4>
                <p><em>This game is based on Silvia Federici's analysis in "Caliban and the Witch." You'll experience how the witch hunts functioned as a tool of primitive accumulation, destroying women's autonomy to enforce capitalist and patriarchal control.</em></p>

                <p>You are Margaret, a village healer who learned the properties of herbs from your grandmother. For years, people have come to you when the official physicians failed them - or when they couldn't afford their services.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your Knowledge:</strong> You know which plants ease pain, which can help a difficult birth, and which can prevent pregnancy. This knowledge has saved lives, but it also makes you dangerous to those who want to control women's bodies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your Situation:</strong> Recently, a priest has been preaching against "folk magic" and the new university-trained physicians claim your methods are primitive. Some villagers still trust you, but others whisper that your successes come from dark powers.</p>

                <p><strong>Your Knowledge:</strong> You understand childbirth, can ease labor pains, and know the old songs and rituals that comfort mothers. You also know which herbs can end an unwanted pregnancy - knowledge that's becoming increasingly dangerous.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your Situation:</strong> The Church is trying to control childbirth, requiring priests to be present at births. Male physicians are claiming that women are unfit to practice medicine. Your very profession is under attack.</p>

                <p><strong>Your Situation:</strong> As common lands are enclosed and old customs banned, your role as keeper of traditional knowledge makes you a symbol of the disappearing world. Some see you as a relic, others as a threat to the new order.</p>
