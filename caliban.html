            <p><strong>Europe, 15th-17th centuries.</strong> The world is changing rapidly. Old ways of life are being destroyed as capitalism takes hold. Commons are being enclosed. Women are losing their economic independence.</p>

            <h3>The Historical Context</h3>
            <p><strong>The witch hunts were not about superstition.</strong> As feminist historian Silvia Federici argues in "Caliban and the Witch," they were a systematic attack on women's autonomy during the rise of capitalism.</p>
            
            <h4>Why Women Were Targeted:</h4>
            <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto;">
                <li><strong>Economic Independence:</strong> Women who lived alone, had their own income, or controlled property</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Knowledge:</strong> Healers, midwives, and herbalists whose skills challenged emerging male-dominated medicine</li>
                <li><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> Those who opposed new laws restricting women's behavior and mobility</li>
                <li><strong>Control of Reproduction:</strong> Women who knew about contraception, abortion, or childbirth</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>"The witch hunt was a war against women; it was a coordinated effort to degrade them, demonize them, and destroy their social power."</em> - Silvia Federici</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p><strong>Level 1:</strong> You'll draw tarot cards representing situations during the witch hunts. Each choice affects your Suspicion Level and number of Allies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Level 2:</strong> If your suspicion reaches 100%, you'll face the brutal reality of a witch trial. Your goal becomes psychological survival through the ordeal.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> Each card offers two options - often a choice between safety and resistance, or between individual survival and helping others.</p>
            
            <div class="game-mechanics-preview">
                <h4>Theoretical Foundation</h4>
                <p><em>This game is based on Silvia Federici's analysis in "Caliban and the Witch." You'll experience how the witch hunts functioned as a tool of primitive accumulation, destroying women's autonomy to enforce capitalist and patriarchal control.</em></p>
