    <p>
        <em>Mapping Commons</em> is an artistic research project that investigates
        stickers as indicators of places of commons and practices of commoning
        in urban space. The project is inspired by Silvia Federici’s feminist
        framework of the commons, which understands commoning as a relational,
        collective, and ongoing practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this work, I photographed and catalogued over 100 stickers found on
        street signs and traffic lights in the area surrounding my apartment.
        Each sticker was documented with attention to its origin, iconography,
        political message, and spatial context.
    </p>

    <p>
        From this material, I created a structured dataset and programmed an
        interactive map visualizing the geographic distribution and connections
        between sticker-based commoning practices. The resulting visualization
        revealed a networked, <em>mycelial</em> structure of commoning across urban
        space, highlighting informal, cross-regional practices of cooperation
        and community.
    </p>

    <p>
        Methodologically, the project combines ethnographic observation, digital
        mapping, and artistic research to make visible forms of collective
        infrastructure that often remain unnoticed in everyday life. Stickers
        function here as both medium and marker: ephemeral, informal, and
        collectively produced traces of shared political and social imaginaries.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project can be read as an analysis of sticker culture as a medium
        through which places of commons emerge and persist, understood in light
        of Federici’s concept of commoning as an active, relational process rather
        than a fixed resource.
