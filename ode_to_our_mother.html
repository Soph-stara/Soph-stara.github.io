<h1>Ode to Our Mother</h1>

<div class="content">

    <p>
        We write to the ground beneath us,<br>
        to the water remembering our names,<br>
        to the air carrying our excess.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project is a poetic reflection on care,<br>
        extraction, and interdependence.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Ode to Our Mother</em> is an artistic research project that seeks to evoke
        reverence for nature by foregrounding human dependence on natural
        ecosystems. It draws connections between poetic insight and visual
        representation, inviting a contemplative engagement with ecological
        relations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The research was conducted through the combination of poetry and nature
        photography, creating a visual–literary dialogue that guides viewers
        through the poems while preserving space for personal interpretation.
        Rather than illustrating the text directly, the images operate alongside
        the poems as parallel modes of sensing and meaning-making.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within this project, I developed a conceptual framework in which
        photographs function as interpretative lenses. They render the poems
        more approachable while encouraging reflection on ecological,
        emotional, and relational themes. Together, text and image form an
        invitation to slow down, attend, and respond with care.
    </p>

    <p><em>In devotion.</em></p>
